# Microbiome_MR_review
Accompanying scripts, data and figures for the systematic review assessing the application of Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease.

## Data
Raw and cleaned dataset of information extracted from the records included in the systematic review alongside datasets used for the meta-analyses of MR effect estimates within individual records and across records, where exposure (and unit) are the same, the outcome (and unit) are the same and the outcome study sources are different across estimates, and the comparison of estimates across recrods where the same analyses were conducted.

## Figures
All figures presenting meta-analysis results of MR effect estimates within individual records (i.e., the "WithinStudy" folder) and across records (i.e., the "BetweenStudies" folder), where exposure (and unit) are the same, the outcome (and unit) are the same and the outcome study sources are different across estimates. Also includes figures of the comparisons of estimates across records where the same analyses were conducted using the same data sources for the exposure (i.e., effect estimates of the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the exposure) and the outcome (i.e., SNP-outcome estimates) - i.e., the "SameAnalyses" folder. 

## Results
All results of the meta-analysis of MR effect estimates within individual records (i.e., the "WithinStudy" folder) and across records (i.e., the "BetweenStudies" folder), where exposure (and unit) are the same, the outcome (and unit) are the same and the outcome study sources are different across estimates. Also includes results files of the comparisons of estimates across records where the same analyses were conducted using the same data sources for the exposure and the outcome (i.e., the "SameAnalyses" folder). 

## Scripts
All scripts used to manipulate and clean the raw data extracted from all records included in the systematic review, create summary statistics presented in the manuscript and meta-analyse the results within and across records.
